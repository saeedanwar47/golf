# 1. generate golf stick bbox and golf stick segmentation mask 

# 2. generate door bbox and door segmentation mask 
# 3. get contours of golf stick segmentation mask 
# 4. find 4 keypoint on the stick 
# 5. connect those keypoints to form 2 lines
# 6. calculate the angle and caclculate lie angle 
# 7. calculate the edges of the door that align with the mask 
# 8. fix the lie angle according to the tilt angle
